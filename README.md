# Bamazon 
Bamazon is a inventory and sales manager and is in no way related to that company named after the rainforest in Brazil. Bamazon offers the user three ways of operating the database: as a customer, a manager and a supervisor.

### Customer
As a customer, the user can view the list of available products and see their ID, name and price. The user can then select a product by its ID and enter a quantity that they would like to purchase. When an item is purchased, its quantity deplenishes and the product sales increases.

### Manager
The manager view allows the user to control inventory. The manager can view all items like the customer, but also gets to see the quantities available along with a unique view that only shows low quantity items. The manager then can select an item by ID and restock inventory. New items can also be added to the database by the manager.

### Supervisor
This view is more overhead and gives the user the ability to analyze the database by department. The supervisor can view all overhead costs, product costs and total profit by department. New departments can be created from this view as well.
